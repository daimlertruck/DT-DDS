# DT-UI - Design System Library

This is DT-UI component library repository. It contains UI components, brand themes, examples and documentation for the Daimler Truck multi-brand design system.
DT-UI component library is headless and can be used to serve multiple brands.

#### **DT-UI provides:**

- A unified group of utility functions commonly used, and spread across different projects
- A unified group of reusable UI components commonly used, and spread across different projects
- W3C standards, common tooling, and high quality through CI/CD lifecycle
- Accessibility meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Faster developments and implementations
- Easy collaboration and Maintenance
- Versioning and changelogs
- Documentation

#### **Documentation via:**

- [Storybook/Developer documentation](https://git.t3.daimlertruck.com/pages/DT-Design-System/dt-ui/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RdxGI4OUcKDRfBRPmBJXbW/DT_UI-Design-System)
- [Confluence](https://con.t3.daimlertruck.com/display/DTUI/DT+Design+System+Home)

## üì¶ Installation

At the moment, DT UI is available as an npm package, `@dt-ui/react`, for React and frameworks using React, like NextJS (compatible with Server-side rendering).

### Setup

#### Get your API key from Artifactory

Go to **Edit Profile** page in [Artifactory](https://art.t3.daimlertruck.com/). You can find an **API key** field in the **Authentication Settings** section.

If the API key field is empty, you can click on the button to generate the key.

#### Create `.npmrc` file

Inside your project root folder create a file

```bash
touch .npmrc
```

#### **Configuring the npm Client for a Scope Registry**

Scopes can be associated with a separate registry. This allows you to seamlessly use a mix of packages from the public npm registry and one or more private registries. You need to paste the following into the .npmrc file instead:

```
@dt-ui:registry=https://art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:_password=<BASE64_PASSWORD>
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:username=<USERNAME>
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:email=youremail@daimlertruck.com
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:always-auth=true
```

Encode your `<apiKey>` to `<BASE64_PASSWORD>` using an appropriate [encoding tool like this one](https://www.base64encode.org).

Your `<USERNAME>` should include "_user_@tbdir.net".

### Install DT UI package

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add @dt-ui/react
```

**npm:**

```bash
npm install @dt-ui/react
```

## üî® Usage

Import the DT UI global styles in the root component.

```tsx
import '@dt-ui/react/index.css';
```

And wrap your code in a `ThemeProvider` component to make it available to all components.

```tsx
import { Provider as ThemeProvider, theme } from '@dt-ui/react';

function App() {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    ...
  <ThemeProvider/>
}
```

For now, there is only available one theme (the default one).

### Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

- `apps/docs`: Developer documentation site, built with Storybook
- `packages/dt-ui-react`: Core React components
- `packages/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo
- `packages/eslint-config-custom`: ESLint preset
- `packages/jest-config`: Shared jest configuration file
- `packages/changeset-conventional-commits`: Changeset plugin used to automatically generate changesets and tagging versions

#### Compilation

To make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.

Running `yarn build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `dt-ui-react`, you should see a folder `dt-ui-react/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
dt-ui-react
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css   <-- CSS file
    ...
```

### Components

Each file inside of `dt-ui-react/components` is a component inside our design system.

When adding a new component, ensure the component is also exported from the root entry `index.ts` file:

```tsx:dt-ui-react/index.ts
export * from './components/buttons';
// Add new component exports here
```

### Developer Documentation

DT UI developer documentation is built with Storybook. Storybook documentation is composed by:

- Documentation pages
- Component stories

Both supports [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), which allows you to use Markdown syntax and JSX for more advanced components.

For more information on Storybook and Docs, read the following documentation and blog posts:

- https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-docs
- https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-docs/introduction
- https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-docs-sneak-peak-5be78445094a
- https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/document/

#### How to generate a boilerplate for new component-package?

Components are independent packages that should be created in the workspace `packages/react-packages/**`

To facilitate this process and keep consistency across all components, please make use of the following script:

```bash
yarn component:create

? What is the name of the package without suffix "@dt-ui/react-" e.g, box, accordion, empty-state.
```

Provide a name for your component and you will have the component generated with:

- `story` file for storyboook
- `styled` file for styled-component
- `test` file for tests
- `index`file with component example

All the integration with storybook and `dt-ui-react` main library will be provided automatically.

#### How to add documentation pages?

Add a file with `.stories.mdx` extension inside `apps/docs` directory, following the instructions on https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-docs/mdx#documentation-only-mdx.
Afterwards, the page is included automatically in the documentation.

If you created custom components to import in the page or a lot of subpages, we recommend to create a sub-directory for all the files related to the page and subpages, including the MDX file(s). The page(s) will still be included automatically.

Note: On Storybook v6, documentation pages still use the `.stories.mdx` extension (otherwise they are not included). On v7 these pages can use `.mdx` extension.

#### How to add component stories?

In case you want to add documentation more complex than the usual component stories, add a `.stories.mdx` file alongside with the component inside `packages/dt-ui-react/components`, or convert the current story in Component Story Format (CSF) to MDX format (see an example of the conversion on https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-docs/mdx#mdx-flavored-csf).

For more information on how to write MDX stories see https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-docs/mdx#writing-stories.

Note: MDX and CSF stories can't coexist in the same directory.

### Versioning & Publishing Packages

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and [changeset-conventional-commits (forked - custom package)](packages/changeset-conventional-commits/README.md) to manage versions and create changelogs.

#### Workflow

- `changeset-conventional-commits`: Generates changesets based on conventional commits
- `Changesets`: Consumes the changesets in order to bump the packages version and it's dependencies
- `changeset-conventional-commits`: At last, commits the new packages version and changelogs with summary: `release: version packages` and tag it using the format: `<package-name>@<package-version>`

#### Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `yarn changeset:add` followed by `yarn changeset:version` locally, you'll have the changelogs generated from the conventional commits as follows:

```markdown
# @package/example

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- fix(container)!: remove ability to specify the container background

### Minor Changes

- feat(button): add new property to enable different shadows

### Patch Changes

- docs: move Storybook to docs application
- docs: add support section in README
- docs: add Usage section on README
- fix: remove page components
```

üõ† This is the default format provided by changesets, it's not so flexible to customize, however we have some room for improvement, check it out: [modifying the changelog formats](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/modifying-changelog-format.md)

#### Releasing

When you merge your code to the `main` branch, the pipeline will run the `VersionAndTag` step with `yarn changeset:ci` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
yarn changesets:add && yarn changesets:version && yarn changesets:tag
```

Respectively runs:

```bash
node scripts/changeset-plugin --add-changesets
```

```bash
changeset version
```

```bash
node scripts/changeset-plugin --add-tag
```

Those commands will be responsible to:

- Generate changeset based on the last conventional commits since the last tagged version
- Bump packages with semver based on changeset files
- Commit generated `CHANGELOG.md` files and updated `package.json` files, adding the summary: `release: version packages`
  - Adds git-tag for the new packages version and push changes.

üõ† Finally after versioning and tagging, the pack and publish is done in the pipeline in the step `BuildAndPublish` by running the following commands for the `@dt-ui/react` package:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn pack`
- `yarn publish`

The `BuildAndPublish` step only runs if the previous `VersionAndTag` step has been run successfully
