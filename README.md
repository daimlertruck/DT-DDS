# DT-UI - Design System Library

This is DT-UI component library repository. It contains UI components, brand themes, examples and documentation for the Daimler Truck multi-brand desing system.
DT-UI component library is headless and can be used to serve multiple brands.

#### **DT-UI provides:**

- A unified group of utility functions commonly used, and spread across different projects
- A unified group of reusable UI components commonly used, and spread across different projects
- W3C standards, common tooling, and high quality through CI/CD lifecycle
- Accessibility meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Faster developments and implementations
- Easy collaboration and Maintenance
- Versioning and changelogs
- Documentation

#### **Documentation via:**

- [Storybook](https://git.t3.daimlertruck.com/pages/DT-Design-System/dt-ui/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RdxGI4OUcKDRfBRPmBJXbW/DT_UI-Design-System)

### Useful Commands

- `yarn build` - Build all packages, including the Storybook site
- `yarn dev` - Run all packages locally
- `yarn lint` - Lint all packages
- `yarn clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)
- `yarn format` - Format all TypeScript, TypeScript with JSX, and Markdown files based on prettier
- `yarn test` - Run tests for all packages
- `yarn changesets:add` - Generates changesets based on conventional commits
- `yarn changesets:version` - Consumes all changesets, and updates to the most appropriate semver version based on those changesets. It also writes changelog entries for each consumed changeset
- `yarn changesets:tag` - Commits the newly created changelogs with the latest packages version and adds the git-tag as `<package-name>@<package-version>`
- `yarn changesets:ci` - Runs the whole changesets flow, useful for pipelines to generate changesets, versioning and tags
- üöß `yarn release` - Build all packages and run npm publish in each package that is of a later version than the one currently listed on npm


### Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

- üöß `apps/docs`: Component documentation site
- `packages/dt-ui-react`: Core React components
- `packages/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo
- `packages/eslint-config-custom`: ESLint preset
- `packages/jest-config`: Shared jest configuration file
- `packages/changeset-conventional-commits`: Changeset plugin used to automatically generate changesets and tagging versions

### Compilation

To make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.

Running `yarn build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `dt-ui-react`, you should see a folder `dt-ui-react/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
dt-ui-react
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css   <-- CSS file
    ...
```

## Components

Each file inside of `dt-ui-react/components` is a component inside our design system.

When adding a new component, ensure the component is also exported from the root entry `index.ts` file:

```tsx:dt-ui-react/index.ts
export * from './components/buttons';
// Add new component exports here
```

### Developer Documentation

DT UI developer documentation is built with Storybook. Storybook documentation is composed by:

- Documentation pages
- Component stories

Both supports [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), which allows you to use Markdown syntax and JSX for more advanced components.

For more information on Storybook and Docs, read the following documentation and blog posts:

- https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-docs
- https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-docs/introduction
- https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-docs-sneak-peak-5be78445094a
- https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/document/
- https://storybook.js.org/blog/structuring-your-storybook/

#### How to add documentation pages?

If you created custom components to import in the page or a lot of subpages, we recommend to create a sub-directory for all the files related to the page and subpages, including the MDX file(s). The page(s) will still be included automatically.

Note: On Storybook v6, documentation pages still use the `.stories.mdx` extension (otherwise they are not included). On v7 these pages can use `.mdx` extension.

#### How to add component stories?

In case you want to add documentation more complex than the usual component stories, add a `.stories.mdx` file alongside with the component inside `packages/dt-ui-react/components`, or convert the current story in Component Story Format (CSF) to MDX format (see an example of the conversion on https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-docs/mdx#mdx-flavored-csf).

For more information on how to write MDX stories see https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-docs/mdx#writing-stories.

Note: MDX and CSF stories can't coexist in the same directory.

### Versioning & Publishing Packages

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and [changeset-conventional-commits (forked - custom package)](packages/changeset-conventional-commits/README.md) to manage versions and create changelogs. 

#### Workflow

- `changeset-conventional-commits`: Generates changesets based on conventional commits
- `Changesets`: Consumes the changesets in order to bump the packages version and it's dependencies
- `changeset-conventional-commits`: At last, commits the new packages version and changelogs with summary: `release: version packages` and tag it using the format: `<package-name>@<package-version>`  

#### Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `yarn changeset:add` followed by `yarn changeset:version` locally, you'll have the changelogs generated from the conventional commits as follows:

```markdown
# @package/example

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- fix(container)!: remove ability to specify the container background

### Minor Changes

- feat(button): add new property to enable different shadows

### Patch Changes

- docs: move Storybook to docs application
- docs: add support section in README
- docs: add Usage section on README
- fix: remove page components
```

 üõ† This is the default format provided by changesets, it's not so flexible to customize, however we have some room for improvement, check it out: [modifying the changelog formats](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/modifying-changelog-format.md)

#### Releasing

When you merge your code to the `alpha` branch, the pipeline will run the `VersionAndTag` step with `yarn changeset:ci` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash 
yarn changesets:add && yarn changesets:version && yarn changesets:tag 
```
Respectively runs:

```bash 
node scripts/changeset-plugin --add-changesets
```

```bash 
changeset version
```

```bash 
node scripts/changeset-plugin --add-tag
```

Those commands will be responsible to:
 - Generate changeset based on the last conventional commits since the last tagged version
 - Bump packages with semver based on changeset files
 - Commit generated `CHANGELOG.md` files and updated `package.json` files, adding the summary: `release: version packages`
   - Adds git-tag for the new packages version and push changes.

üõ† Finally after versioning and tagging, the pack and publish is done in the pipeline in the step `BuildAndPublish` by running the following commands for the `@dt-ui/react` package:
 
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn build`
 - `yarn pack`
 - `yarn publish`

 The `BuildAndPublish` step only runs if the previous `VersionAndTag` step has been run successfully
