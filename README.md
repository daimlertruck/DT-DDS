- Documentation

#### **Documentation via:**

- [Storybook/Developer documentation](https://daimlertruck.github.io/daimlertruck/dt-ui/)
- [Figma (private design files)](https://www.figma.com/file/RdxGI4OUcKDRfBRPmBJXbW/DT_UI-Design-System)
- [Confluence (private docs)](https://con.t3.daimlertruck.com/display/DTUI/DT+Design+System+Home)

## üì¶ Installation

At the moment, DT-UI is available as an npm package, `@dt-ui/react`, for React and frameworks using React, like NextJS (compatible with Server-side rendering).

### Setup

#### Get your API key from Artifactory (private installs only)

Go to **Edit Profile** page in [Artifactory](https://art.t3.daimlertruck.com/). You can find an **API key** field in the **Authentication Settings** section.

If the API key field is empty, you can click on the button to generate the key.

#### Create `.npmrc` file

Inside your project root folder create a file

```bash
touch .npmrc
```

#### **Configuring the npm Client for a Scope Registry**

Scopes can be associated with a separate registry. This allows you to seamlessly use a mix of packages from the public npm registry and one or more private registries. You need to paste the following into the .npmrc file instead:

```
@dt-ui:registry=https://art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:_password=<BASE64_PASSWORD>
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:username=<USERNAME>
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:email=youremail@daimlertruck.com
//art.t3.daimlertruck.com/artifactory/api/npm/DTUI_NPM_LOCAL/:always-auth=true
```

Encode your `<apiKey>` to `<BASE64_PASSWORD>` using an appropriate [encoding tool like this one](https://www.base64encode.org).

### Install DT UI package

```bash
yarn add @dt-ui/react
```

### Install package dependencies

`@dt-ui/react` uses CSS-IN-JS behind the scenes. You'll need to add Emotion as a project dependency.

```bash
yarn add @emotion/css @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## üî® Usage

Import the DT UI global styles in the root component.

```tsx
import '@dt-ui/react/index.css';
```

And wrap your code in a `ThemeProvider` component to make it available to all components.

```tsx
import { Provider as ThemeProvider, theme } from '@dt-ui/react';

function App() {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    ...
  <ThemeProvider/>
}
```

For now, there is only available one theme (the default one).
