- W3C standards, common tooling, and high quality through CI/CD lifecycle
- Accessibility meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Faster developments and implementations
- Easy collaboration and Maintenance
- Versioning and changelogs
- Documentation

#### **Documentation via:**

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - to test UI components in a user-centric way
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- üöß [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning and changelogs
- [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) ‚Äî TypeScript bundler powered by esbuild

### Useful Commands

- `yarn build` - Build all packages, including the Storybook site
- `yarn dev` - Run all packages locally
- `yarn lint` - Lint all packages
- `yarn clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)
- `yarn format` - Format all TypeScript, TypeScript with JSX, and Markdown files based on prettier
- `yarn test` - Run tests for all packages
- üöß `yarn changeset` - Generate a changeset
- üöß `yarn version-packages` - consumes all changesets, and updates to the most appropriate semver version based on those changesets. It also writes changelog entries for each consumed changeset
- üöß `yarn release` - Build all packages and run npm publish in each package that is of a later version than the one currently listed on npm

## Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

- üöß `apps/docs`: Component documentation site
- `packages/dt-ui-react`: Core React components
- `packages/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo
- `packages/eslint-config-custom`: ESLint preset
- `packages/jest-config`: Shared jest configuration file

### Compilation

To make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.

Running `yarn build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `dt-ui-react`, you should see a folder `dt-ui-react/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
dt-ui-react
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css   <-- CSS file
    ...
```

## Components

Each file inside of `dt-ui-react/components` is a component inside our design system.

When adding a new component, ensure the component is also exported from the root entry `index.ts` file:

```tsx:dt-ui-react/index.ts
export * from './components/buttons';
// Add new component exports here
```

## üöß Versioning & Publishing Packages

This example uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediately.

You'll need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add it to your GitHub repository settings to enable access to npm. It's also worth installing the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your repository.

### üöß Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `pnpm changeset` locally:

1. **Which packages would you like to include?** ‚Äì This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the packages you want to include in the `changeset`.
1. **Which packages should have a major bump?** ‚Äì Press `space` to select the packages you want to bump versions for.
1. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.
1. Write a summary for the changes.
1. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.
1. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.

### üöß Releasing

When you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
turbo run build --filter=docs^... && changeset publish
```

‚ö†Ô∏è All flagged üöß information on this file needs further review since might not be working as expected.
