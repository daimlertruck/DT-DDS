# Core Package

The Core Package provides a centralized collection of shared utilities, hooks, components, constants and types. This package is designed to enhance the development experience by promoting code reusability and maintaining consistency across various components.

## Stack

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) — JavaScript library for user interfaces
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) — for writing css styles with JavaScript
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) — UI component environment powered by Vite
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript Testing Framework
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - to test UI components in a user-centric way
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) — TypeScript bundler powered by esbuild
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) from managing packages

## Commands

- `yarn build` - Build the package
- `yarn dev` - Run the package locally
- `yarn lint` - Lint all files within this package
- `yarn test` Run all unit tests

## Compilation

Running `yarn build` from the root of the package will use [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript.

The `/dist` folder contains the compiled output.

```bash
core
└── dist
    ├── index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ├── index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    └── index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
    ...
